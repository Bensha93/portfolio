## Projects
### Motorcycle Parts Sales Data Analysis

[Publication](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/e73e6faf-7daa-42ce-ba32-01cf3c49f9c1/edit#ff58f388)

### Project Description

In this project, I worked with a motorcycle parts company to analyze their sales data and provide insights into their wholesale revenue. The company operates three warehouses and sells a variety of motorcycle parts through both retail and wholesale channels, accepting multiple payment methods, each with different associated fees.

### Objectives

The main goal of this analysis was to assist the board of directors in understanding wholesale revenue trends by product line, month, and warehouse. Key tasks included:

- **Data Access**: Utilizing SQL to query the company's sales database, specifically focusing on the "sales" table that contains detailed sales records.
- **Data Filtering**: Filtering the dataset to include only wholesale orders for accurate analysis.
- **Net Revenue Calculation**: Calculating net revenue for each product line by accounting for the fees associated with different payment methods.
- **Data Visualization**: Using Power BI to create interactive dashboards that display the monthly and warehouse-specific wholesale revenue trends.

### Tools and Technologies

- **SQL**: For querying and manipulating the sales data.
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and creating interactive reports.

### Outcomes

The analysis provided the board with critical insights into wholesale performance, enabling informed decision-making regarding inventory management and sales strategies. This project enhanced my skills in SQL and Power BI, showcasing my ability to transform raw data into actionable business intelligence.
