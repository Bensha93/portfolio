## PROJECTS

## Project 1

- ### Motorcycle Part Sales Analysis (June - August 2021)

This project involved analyzing motorcycle part sales data over a three-month period using SQL and PowerBI. The focus was on understanding total sales, orders, and quantities sold, alongside trends and performance comparisons. By cleaning and transforming the data, I uncovered key insights into sales by product category, store location, and client type.

I developed Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), analyzed daily and weekly sales trends, and performed dimensional analysis to provide a comprehensive view of business performance. The results informed actionable strategies for optimizing sales and improving overall business outcomes.

## Project 2
- ### Nobel Prize Data Analysis (1901-2023)

In this project, I explore a Nobel Prize dataset (1901-2023) using Python, uncovering trends and answering key questions about the history of Nobel laureates. Through data analysis, I examined patterns related to gender, birth countries, and the prevalence of US-born winners. Additionally, I explored female representation across decades and categories, identified the first female laureate, and investigated individuals or organizations that have won multiple Nobel Prizes.

Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn were used to clean, analyze, and visualize the data, delivering clear insights into over a century of Nobel Prize history.
