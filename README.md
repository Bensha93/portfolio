## PROJECTS:

## Project 1

- ### Motorcycle Part Sales Analysis (June - August 2021)

This project involved analyzing motorcycle part sales data over a three-month period using SQL and PowerBI. The focus was on understanding total sales, orders, and quantities sold, alongside trends and performance comparisons. By cleaning and transforming the data, I uncovered key insights into sales by product category, store location, and client type.

I developed Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), analyzed daily and weekly sales trends, and performed dimensional analysis to provide a comprehensive view of business performance. The results informed actionable strategies for optimizing sales and improving overall business outcomes.

## Project 2
- ### Nobel Prize Data Analysis (1901-2023)

In this project, I explore a Nobel Prize dataset (1901-2023) using Python, uncovering trends and answering key questions about the history of Nobel laureates. Through data analysis, I examined patterns related to gender, birth countries, and the prevalence of US-born winners. Additionally, I explored female representation across decades and categories, identified the first female laureate, and investigated individuals or organizations that have won multiple Nobel Prizes.

Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn were used to clean, analyze, and visualize the data, delivering clear insights into over a century of Nobel Prize history.

## Project 3
- ### Hypothesis Testing on Goal Scoring in Men’s vs. Women’s Soccer

This project analyzed whether women’s FIFA World Cup matches see more goals scored on average than men’s. Using historical match data since 2002, I conducted a statistical hypothesis test at a 10% significance level to compare scoring patterns. The analysis provided a data-driven insight for sports journalism, revealing scoring trends across men’s and women’s World Cup games.

![Hypothesis](assest/soccer-pitch.jpg)

**Tools Used: Python**

- **Pandas** for data cleaning and manipulation of match records.

- **NumPy** for efficient numerical operations.

- **SciPy** for conducting the hypothesis test.

- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** for visualizing goal-scoring trends.

These tools enabled thorough data analysis, statistical validation, and clear visualizations to support findings on goal-scoring dynamics in international soccer.
